# Abstract
I would like to develop a project that can take new survey data each term (either directly from Qualtrics via an API or from downloaded .csv files) and quickly create a report. Portions of this project would include
1. A process to import and clean the data each term.
2. One or more standard visualizations of Likert-type item data.
3. Organization and/or parsing of open-ended text responses.
4. Report Template
