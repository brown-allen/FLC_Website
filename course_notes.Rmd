##Pseudocode into Code
Following session three, I spent time writing out the steps I might need to create one "Tidy" data frame that includes survey responses from each course. That looked like this:
1. Read in various .csv files (all placed in common data folder)
2. Remove metadata headers...first two columns (repeat for each file)
3. Combine into one data frame
4. Isolate Likert-type items
5. Tidy data - gather into a longer table such that each response is its own entry

I then worked to write simplistic code to accomplish this task, which looked something like this:

> read_csv(“data/file_name1.csv”)
> file_name1_no_hd <- file_name1[-c(1,2), ]
> all_data <- rbind(file_name1_no_hd, file_name2_no_hd,...)
> all_likert <- all_data[ , -c(1:8, 10:17, 22, 29:38, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 64:86)]
> all_likert <- gather(all_likert, key = "Question", value = "Response", -ResponseId)

I then worked to identify strategies to streamline this process. For the next session, I am hoping to make progress on writing 1 or more functions to expedite the data import process. Additionally, I am hoping to begin some preliminary visualization work.
